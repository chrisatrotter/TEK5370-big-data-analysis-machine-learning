# TEK5370_BigData
Code made for data gathering on an influx database connected to a Homeassistant.
This code was made in a hosted jupyter notebook as i ran into some roadblocks regarding the influx client not downloading correctly.
The code should also work in python if all packages are downloaded. 

Some other prerequisites:
- You need to connect to the Wireguard VPN
- Make sure the influx client package is downloaded
  - If ran in a jupyter notebook, it shouldn't be an issue.
